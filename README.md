# Project Description

You're tasked with creating a modern blog layout for a fictitious Client. The layout, hierarchy, and user experience of this blog landing page are entirely up to you. So are visuals and functionality, which can be as minimal or fully fleshed out as you see fit, as long as everything meets the content requirements listed in the section below.

If you feel they might assist you in this project, the following are fair game, but not required:
- Dummy content or image generators
- CSS frameworks and preprocessors
- JavaScript frameworks and plugins

## AC

- [x] Global Header ---- The page's header should contain The Client's logo, a "main navigation" of about five (dummy) links, and a secondary "eyebrow navigation" of two or three links.

- [x] Articles ---- The main content of this blog landing page is a listing of at least five article summaries. Each article needs: A title, Date it was published, A short summary of the story - A link to the full story, A preview image for the story

- [x] Archive ---- The archive is a blog-style list of links to view past articles by year.

- [x] Popular Content ---- There are three types of popular content The Client would like to promote, each featuring 10 article links: Most Viewed, Most Commented, Most Shared (The Client suggested a tabbed widget for these three lists, but the final solution is up to you.)

- [x] Newsletter ---- The Client is asking for a simple call to action to sign up for the blog's newsletter. A form that captures the reader's email address should suffice.

- [x] Global Footer ---- The page's footer will only contain a copyright statement with the year and The Client's name.

## Dependencies Used
- React Icons
- React Router Dom

# How to Run
Can be viewed [here on Netlify](https://lifeblue-blog.netlify.app).
## To Run Locally:

- Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/GabbyJ/lifeblue-blog.git`
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Start server with `npm start`

## Issues to watch for

- Not yet responsive on small devices but will be in the near future once work slows down or I get a new job ðŸ˜‰
    - Update: Now responsive on tablet and small devices

# Potential new features to make it better:

- Create Dark Mode
- Sliding Featured Blog carousel
- Use more JSX features to make the blog appear more functional and the code cleaner
- Add social media meta tags

<summary>Getting Started with Create React App</summary>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
